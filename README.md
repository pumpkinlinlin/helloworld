###  HW0 : Use modules and googlespread to make a wordcloud
* Web crawler (BeautufulSoup/requests) [crawler](https://github.com/shiny880410/helloworld/blob/master/hw0/20190301/craw.py)
* Save and search the news with keywords (gspread) [googleSpreadSheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I-m9HwjiPkYES3Ll5PvWk-xijm_9bcn_jxnDOhtpnZE/edit?usp=sharing)
* Cut the news and make the wordcloud (jieba/wordcloud) [hw0](https://github.com/shiny880410/helloworld/blob/master/hw0/20190301/20190301.py)

### HW1 : Collecting data from the website and changing them to Tidy Data (gspread) [crawler](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FJPf9S2vpimDZvefrpnfq31cq3JpmySHse74WQoEgu4/edit?usp=sharing)
* The data is from Taipei city government website (Update every five minutes) [data](https://data.taipei/dataset/detail/preview?id=b5aaf33a-a6dc-4836-bce6-09986241fe11&rid=8a2ea001-f483-4441-a458-af697653296c)
* 7 observation spots on 復興路 and 9 observation spots on 建國高架
* Average car speed in weekdays (Mon. to Fri.)
* To know the relation between car speed and time, we do the data tidying 
to make variables forms a column, and the observation in the same timeforms a row
* To eliminate the meaningless fluctuations, we average the speed every 15 minutes
## **2019-03-14 Week4**
### HW2&3 : Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) : Speed on the Roads
* Q1 : How does the speed varies with time?
	* We listed the data according to the location of the spot on the road and time
* Q2 : Can we assume that the speed at each and every adjacent observation spot are the same?
	* Draw the line graph of car speed on each spot during a day (matplotlib) [Line Graph](https://github.com/shiny880410/helloworld/blob/master/hw1/linegraph.ipynb)

	* The difference in speed between spots are subtle but important
	* Draw the line graph that varies with time during a day (matplotlib) [Line Graph2](https://github.com/shiny880410/helloworld/blob/master/hw1/復興南路2.ipynb)
* Q3 : The relation between adjacent observation spots
	* We found that the speed curve of some adjacent observation spots  have the same trend
	* We plot the v-t curve again with z-score to vanish the gap between spots

## **2019-03-21 Week5**
* Q4 : How to define rush hour of a day?
	* Define peak time / off-peak time with the greatest slope : Paired samples t-test
	* The rad spots indicated that p value<= 0.045
	* The numbers in the graph is the weighted average ( w.r.t. the distance of VDs ) of the speed in different spots, which represents the road speed
![image](3)
	* Define peak time / off-peak time with outliers : One sample t-test
	* Result : no specific congestion in traffic ( p value >= 0.05 )
* Q5 : To observe the feature of speed in rush hour of different spot
	* 箱形圖
* Q6 : Heat map of speed
	* Draw the heatmap of car speed of 復興路 during a day (matplotlib) [Heatmap](https://github.com/shiny880410/helloworld/blob/master/hw1/heatmap.ipynb)
![image](https://github.com/shiny880410/helloworld/blob/master/hw1/heatmap.png)
## **2019-03-28 Week6**
* Q7 : We plan to conduct Leibniz integral rule to see that whether the car speeds perform fluid properties
