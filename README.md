## **2019-03-07 Week3**
### HW1 : Collecting data from the website and changing them to Tidy Data (gspread) [crawler](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FJPf9S2vpimDZvefrpnfq31cq3JpmySHse74WQoEgu4/edit?usp=sharing)
* The data is from Taipei city government website (Update every five minutes)
* 7 observation spot on 復興路
* Average car speed in weekdays
* To know the relation between car speed and time, we do the data tidying. 
to make variables forms a column, and the observation in the same timeforms a row.
* To eliminate the meaningless fluctuations, we average the speed every 15 minutes.
## **2019-03-14 Week4**
### HW2&3 : Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) : Speed on the Roads
	* Q1 : 
	* Draw the line graph of car speed on each spot during a day (matplotlib) [Line Graph](https://github.com/shiny880410/helloworld/blob/master/hw1/linegraph.py)
	* To define peak time / off-peak time
